# Graceful exit for library projects (2025-06-16 16:13:18)

_**User**_

in the case that no hashes are found its probably that were running on a library project, so we should gracefully exit rather than causing the ci pipeline to error

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at the script, I can see the issue. When no SHA256 hashes are found, it currently exits with an error code that would fail the CI pipeline. For library projects that don't generate downloadable artifacts, this should be handled gracefully.

Let me update the script to detect library projects and exit gracefully in those cases:

---



---

The script has been updated to gracefully handle library projects. Here's what the changes do:

1. **Library Detection**: When no SHA256 hashes are found, the script now checks if this is likely a library project by looking for:
   - `<OutputType>Library</OutputType>` in `.csproj` files
   - `<PackageId>` elements (indicating NuGet packages)
   - `<GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>` 
   - `.nuspec` files (NuGet package specifications)

2. **Graceful Exit**: If library indicators are found, the script:
   - Displays informative messages explaining why it's skipping
   - Exits with code `0` (success) instead of `1` (error)
   - Prevents CI pipeline failures for legitimate library projects

3. **Fallback Behavior**: If it's not detected as a library project but still has no hashes, it maintains the original error behavior to catch genuine configuration issues.

This change allows the script to work seamlessly in CI pipelines for both application projects (that should generate winget manifests) and library projects (that should skip manifest generation without failing the build).

---

_**User**_

other errors that would occur due to there just not being any applications to export should also be treated in the same way, as non-critical

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're absolutely right. Let me examine the script for other potential failure points when dealing with library projects and make them handle gracefully rather than causing CI failures.

---

Read file: scripts/update-winget-manifests.ps1

---

Let me also check the release fetching section:

---

Read file: scripts/update-winget-manifests.ps1

---

Now let me create a helper function to centralize the library detection logic and modify the script to handle other potential failure points gracefully:

---



---

Now let me update the release fetching section to handle library projects gracefully:

---



---

Now let me update the hash checking section to use the new helper functions:

---



---



---

Now let me add an early check right after project detection to exit gracefully for known library projects before any download attempts:

---



---

Now let me also handle the case where the GitHub CLI upload might fail for library projects (though this section shouldn't be reached for libraries with the early exit):

---



---

Perfect! Here's a summary of the changes I made to handle library projects gracefully throughout the script:

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Helper Functions**
- `Test-IsLibraryProject`: Centralized detection logic for library projects
- `Exit-GracefullyForLibrary`: Standardized graceful exit with informative messages

### 2. **Enhanced Library Detection**
The detection now checks for:
- **C# Libraries**: `<OutputType>Library</OutputType>`, `<PackageId>`, `<GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>`, `<IsPackable>true</IsPackable>`
- **NuGet Packages**: `.nuspec` files
- **Node.js Libraries**: No `bin` field or `private: true` in `package.json`

### 3. **Multiple Graceful Exit Points**
- **Early Detection**: Right after project info detection to avoid unnecessary processing
- **Release Fetch Failure**: If GitHub release information can't be fetched
- **No SHA256 Hashes**: When no downloadable artifacts are found (original location)
- **Upload Failure**: If GitHub CLI upload fails due to missing artifacts

### 4. **Benefits for CI/CD**
- **Exit Code 0**: All library project exits use success code instead of error code
- **Clear Messaging**: Informative console output explaining why the script is skipping
- **Early Exit**: Avoids wasting CI time on unnecessary processing
- **Failure Prevention**: Prevents legitimate library releases from failing CI pipelines

Now the script will:
1. **Detect library projects early** and exit gracefully before any download attempts
2. **Handle missing release artifacts** without failing the build
3. **Provide clear feedback** about why winget manifest generation is being skipped
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** for actual application projects

This ensures that library projects (like your AppData library) won't cause CI pipeline failures while still properly handling application projects that should generate winget manifests.

Yes, **PowerShell 7 is fully compatible with GitHub Actions workflows**! Here's what you need to know:

## ‚úÖ PowerShell 7 Compatibility

**GitHub-hosted runners include PowerShell 7 by default** on all platforms:
- **Windows runners**: PowerShell 7 is pre-installed
- **Ubuntu runners**: PowerShell 7 is pre-installed  
- **macOS runners**: PowerShell 7 is pre-installed

## üöÄ Using PowerShell 7 in GitHub Actions

### Option 1: Use `shell: pwsh` (Recommended)
```yaml
jobs:
  powershell-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # or windows-latest, macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run PowerShell 7 script
        shell: pwsh  # This uses PowerShell 7
        run: |
          Write-Host "PowerShell Version: $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion)"
          .\scripts\update-winget-manifests.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
```

### Option 2: Explicit PowerShell 7 execution
```yaml
- name: Run script with explicit pwsh call
  run: pwsh -File .\scripts\update-winget-manifests.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è For Your Script Specifically

Your script has `#Requires -Version 7.0` at the top, which is perfect for GitHub Actions. Here's how to use it:

```yaml
name: Update Winget Manifests

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  update-manifests:
    runs-on: windows-latest  # or ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Update winget manifests
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          .\scripts\update-winget-manifests.ps1 -Version "${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}"
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## üìù Key Points

1. **No special setup required** - PowerShell 7 comes pre-installed
2. **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS runners
3. **Use `shell: pwsh`** - This ensures PowerShell 7 is used instead of Windows PowerShell 5.1
4. **Version requirement honored** - Your `#Requires -Version 7.0` will work correctly

## üîÑ Alternative: Install Specific PowerShell Version

If you need a specific version of PowerShell 7, you can install it explicitly:

```yaml
- name: Install specific PowerShell version
  uses: bjompen/UpdatePWSHAction@v1
  with:
    ReleaseVersion: 'stable'  # or specific version like '7.4.0'

- name: Run script
  shell: pwsh
  run: .\scripts\update-winget-manifests.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
```

## üéØ Summary

Your PowerShell 7 script will work perfectly in GitHub Actions workflows without any modifications. Just use `shell: pwsh` in your workflow steps, and GitHub Actions will automatically use the pre-installed PowerShell 7 to execute your script with all the modern PowerShell features and cross-platform compatibility you expect.

_**User**_

my solutions sometimes contain libraries and applications dont stop looking for applications just because a library is there too

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're absolutely right! A solution can contain both libraries AND applications, and we shouldn't skip winget manifest generation just because there are library projects present. We need to check if there are ANY application projects, not just whether there are library projects.

Let me fix the logic to properly handle mixed solutions:

---



---

Now I need to update all the places where this function is called to use the new name:

---



---



---



---



---

Perfect! I've updated the script to properly handle mixed solutions. Here's what changed:

## üîÑ **Updated Logic for Mixed Solutions**

### **Before (Problematic)**
- ‚ùå Detected ANY library project ‚Üí Exit gracefully
- ‚ùå Ignored application projects in the same solution

### **After (Fixed)**
- ‚úÖ Scans ALL projects in the solution
- ‚úÖ Identifies both libraries AND applications
- ‚úÖ Only exits gracefully if ALL projects are libraries
- ‚úÖ Continues with winget manifest generation if ANY project is an application

## üß© **New Function: `Test-IsLibraryOnlyProject`**

The updated function now:

1. **Examines all `.csproj` files** in the solution (not just the first one)
2. **Categorizes each project** as either:
   - **Library**: Has `<OutputType>Library</OutputType>`, `<PackageId>`, `<GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>`, etc.
   - **Application**: Has `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>`, `<OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>`, or default console app pattern
3. **Returns true only if** `hasLibraries = true` AND `hasApplications = false`

## üéØ **Example Scenarios**

### **Mixed Solution (Library + Application)**
```
MySolution/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyLibrary/MyLibrary.csproj          # Library project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyApp/MyApp.csproj                  # Console application
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ **Continues** with winget manifest generation for MyApp

### **Library-Only Solution**
```
MySolution/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core/Core.csproj                    # Library project
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Extensions/Extensions.csproj        # Library project
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ **Exits gracefully** - no applications to package

### **Application-Only Solution**
```
MySolution/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyTool/MyTool.csproj               # Console application
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ **Continues** with winget manifest generation

## üìù **Benefits**

1. **No False Positives**: Won't skip winget manifests when there are legitimate applications
2. **Mixed Solution Support**: Handles common patterns like library + CLI tool
3. **Better CI Integration**: Prevents legitimate application releases from being skipped
4. **Accurate Detection**: Examines actual project types rather than making assumptions

This fix ensures that your script will work correctly for solutions that contain both libraries and applications, only skipping winget manifest generation when the entire solution consists solely of library projects.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'IPath' is an ambiguous reference between 'System.IO.Abstractions.IPath' and 'ktsu.Semantics.IPath'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at the linter errors, the interface expects two specific overloads. Replace the generic `IPath` method with these two specific implementations:

---



---

The fix replaces the ambiguous generic `IPath` method with two specific overloads that match the interface requirements: one for `AbsoluteFilePath` and one for `AbsoluteDirectoryPath`. This resolves both the ambiguity error and the interface implementation errors.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Operator '??' cannot be applied to operands of type 'Func<IServiceProvider, IFileSystem>' and 'lambda expression'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The lambda expression needs to match the `Func<IServiceProvider, IFileSystem>` signature. Add the `IServiceProvider` parameter:

---



---

The lambda expressions now match the expected `Func<IServiceProvider, T>` signature by including the `IServiceProvider` parameter (using `_` to indicate it's unused).

---

_**User**_

this doesnt seem right

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right. The issue is we're mixing factory functions incorrectly. Here's the proper fix:

---



---

Now it properly invokes the factory function if provided, or creates a default instance. The lambda parameter `sp` is used to call the factory, avoiding the null coalescing operator type mismatch.
